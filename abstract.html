                            Integrated Learning Project, or ILP, is a multidisciplinary project that combines all subjects into one assignment. According to the Oxford Dictionary, "integrated" means that many different parts are closely connected and work successfully together. In ILP, students apply knowledge and methods from various disciplines to develop a more comprehensive understanding of a topic. At Saint Ursula Jakarta High School, Grade 9 students participate in ILP to merge different subjects into a meaningful project. This year, the ILP centered on organizing a bazaar and a mini showcase, allowing students to develop business, creativity, and teamwork skills. Throughout this project, students explored multiple concepts and developed various skills. A deeper understanding of real-world applications was achieved through collaboration and research. Perspectives from different fields were integrated to ensure a well-rounded learning experience. The researcher named their brand CARTARA, with its mascot being a cute, yellow chicken.

                        <br><br>
                        Despite its benefits, ILP presented several challenges. Team members experienced a lack of communication, leading to misunderstandings. Confusion regarding roles and responsibilities delayed some tasks. However, the team eventually resolved these issues through discussions and compromise. By the end, they felt a sense of accomplishment as they successfully executed the bazaar and showcase. Students exchanged new ideas and discovered solutions through teamwork. They assigned responsibilities to ensure timely completion of each task. Although they encountered obstacles, they overcame them through collaboration and perseverance. In the end, the event was well-received by teachers and students alike.

                        <br><br>
                        Through this experience, students learned many valuable lessons. The importance of hard work was emphasized throughout the project. They strengthened leadership skills by managing responsibilities effectively. Patience and perseverance were required to overcome obstacles. The ability to work under pressure was improved as deadlines approached. The team demonstrated teamwork and dedication through the successful completion of all tasks. They acquired many useful skills, including time management and problem-solving. Essential life skills that will be beneficial in the future were instilled through ILP.
                      
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, ILP fostered personal growth. Students had the opportunity to collaborate with classmates from different backgrounds. The project encouraged creativity as they developed unique ideas for the bazaar and showcase. Lessons about responsibility and accountability were gained throughout this process. Ultimately, ILP was more than just an academic assignment, but it was a journey that fostered intellectual and personal development. A lasting impact was left on everyone involved, making this project a memorable and enriching experience. The skills and experiences gained from this project will continue to be useful in future academics and the professional world. This remarkable journey will be remembered forever.
